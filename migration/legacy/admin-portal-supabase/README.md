# Legacy Admin Portal Supabase Migrations

These files are preserved from the former `endgard-admin-portal/supabase/migrations` directory
so all historical backend code exists in `endgard-backend` before app-side cleanup.

Do not apply these directly as canonical migrations.
Canonical deploy source remains:
- `endgard-backend/supabase/migrations`
