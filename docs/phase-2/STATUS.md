# Phase 2 Status

## Item 3 (Data Migration)
- Decision: intentionally skipped for current dev stage.
- Reason: project is pre-production and does not require legacy data carry-over.
- Impact: no source DB export/import executed.
- Preparedness: full runbook/scripts/SQL retained under `docs/phase-2`, `migration/sql`, and `scripts/migration` for future use.
